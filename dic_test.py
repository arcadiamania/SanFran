The oncologist is actually in North Scottsdale twice weekly, which was an added bonus.\n\nWe met with Dr. Hillers to discuss Big Sexy's treatment options for basal cell carcinoma around his ear.  Our regular vet indicated it would probably be surgery, but suggested we get a specialist involved.  Based only on our initial consultation, I can give Dr. Hillers nothing less than 5 stars.  She was pleasant, good with Mr. Fabulous (Big Sexy, not my husband), and clearly an expert in her field.  Without question, she was interested in doing what's best for the cat, and not the clinic's finances.\n\nBased on the cat's age, intolerance for stress (yes, he pooped once in my car, twice in their office), and other health conditions, she advised neither radiation therapy (5 days per week!) nor radical surgery were the best options, especially given the cost vs the likelihood that the tumors would return anyway.  Instead, she suggested use of a topical cream marketed for the two-legged population, which can be applied at home and will hopefully result in making Big Sexy more comfortable.  We were given the option of a chest x-ray for a metastatic check, but were not encouraged to get it unless we felt it would change our preferred course of treatment.  My husband insisted we get it for my peace of mind, and we were promptly e-mailed the radiologist's report so that we could ignore his recommendation anyway:)\n\nThe consultation was very reasonably priced, and the bloodwork and x-rays were comparable to what my regular vet charges.

I thought they were the ones who were supposed to advocate for their customers, both human and four legged)\n\nThe only positive that I walked away with from DCAH was a referral to Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service. Here they were able to properly diagnose and treatment my dog. No confusion, no miscommunications, just educated professionals that know that a 1 year old pitbull who has a mildly displaced fracture should have a wrap, not full blown surgery, as conducting surgery and placing pins in 1 year olds joint would cause MORE damage than a basic wrap/cast.\n \nIf you ever have an injured animal, skip DCAH and go directly to a board certified doctor who can give you proper diagnosis and treatment.

The truck was muddy as I took it off-road, but it's not the first time and the previous owners always took care of it without any up-charges.  If the car came out just as clean as it used to I probably wouldn't be writing any update to this (previously 4 star review), but instead I found the roof to be dirty and the driver side had numerous swirl marks and a few minor scratches (and no this didn't happen off-roading - there was no mud in this area and I inspect the truck daily...I noticed this as soon as I got home and parked it after the wash).  There are many water marks, the tire spray and interior dressing all appear to have worn off in less than 24 hours and there is over-spray on the fenders.  It does not appear that quality cleaning products are used and either they are not using the correct non-abrasive cleaning cloths or used at least one after it fell on the ground.

As someone who only hand washes my vehicles it is difficult to find a good hand car wash at a reasonable price.  There are some really great detail shops in N. Scottsdale, but most operate by appointment only (which is why I generally don't use mobile services) and can be a little pricier.  Stewart Detailing is the first true hand wash and dry I have found that is in my area, reasonably priced and seems to perform a very good wash.  The only thing I have noticed is the bug cleaning on the front is not a thorough as it should be and I tend to finish the job when I get home.  I have used them four times now with my vehicle and each wash was as good as the last.  They also have a dog wash on premise which I have not utilized yet, but is a pretty good idea and allows customers to do something productive while they wait.  They have a shaded sitting area and two indoor sitting areas, one where customers can view their vehicle being washed which is conducted indoors and another where customers have a view of their vehicle being dried and detailed.  I like being able to keep an eye on my car.\n\nThe staff has been very friendly and took no issue with my occasional request to clean a specific area more thoroughly such as my carpeted truck bed.

You can get boxes with all veggies, all fruit, or a mix of both.  They are also ridiculously accommodating, letting you sub out items if there are things you adore or dislike, and they also fill your box based on your particular diet.

I tried some fruit samples and cannot wait to get my hands on some more.  I love that Trish takes the time to notate anything you may not care for and really individualize your take.  I immediately felt like this was something I wanted to be a part of.

We have shopped the farmers market stand for the entire summer and decided to give the weekly service a try. It is $30 a week, with a starter fee for the cute boxes that have your name engraved on them. I was happy to give a newer small business owner a chance, but often I got the impression that they are doing me the favor and each week I was throwing away a quarter to half the box from rot or wilting produce. I had traded the Bet on the Farm market for their box and it was just okay and highly unpredictable on produce received. At pick up, I found Tim to be friendly, he is good guy with who is well meaning.  In the weekly boxes I have received amazing produce, and then I have received apples that were rotten black, a pomi that was fuzzy moldy inside and black, kiwis that were shriveled, soft bendy carrots, wilted heads of lettuce and spinach, moldy grapes, and the list goes on.  Tim always did his best to make up for the bad produce at the market, but the box always contained some gross produce. A disadvantage over picking it out on your own at the market. They require that you fill out a form that says all the items you want and then make no promises to provide one of those ten requested items. Interesting concept and not exactly consumer friendly.  At the store, Trish is an entitled and confrontational owner that did not impress me at all. We got into it a bit and she made some very snarky comments and behaved like she was doing me a favor for selling me produce that is often delivered moldy or wilted or ready to rot. I\'m not going to deny that it super pissed me off and it took everything I had not explode at her for her aggressive posture, language, and snarky comments. Trish had told Tim that she wanted to "fire" me as a customer and I told Tim that was fine. That evening I got a message from Trish to call her. No reason for the call just to call her back. Did she really expect me to call her after our last friendly experience? Hah! Hilarious. She didn\'t even have the courage to leave an honest message saying that she wasn\'t going to deliver to the west side for my pick up anymore. OK by me. I was already waiting a few months before I was going to review them (one or two deliveries does not make for fair eval) and low and behold they drove their own review destiny with average to extremely poor service and unpredictable product. There are other fabulous options out there.

I am reposting it sans any personal information or other questionable content.**\n\nI called Heart Savers to schedule a BLS for healthcare providers course and spoke to a polite female on the phone. She confirmed there was space available on the date I requested to attend the course, and took my information. \n\nFast forward a couple of days...As luck would have it, there was a terrible accident on the 202 on my way to the class. Ten minutes before class was scheduled to start I phoned Heart Savers to inform them that I would be a few minutes late, but there was no answer. I called sever time over the next 10 minutes to no avail. \n\nI pulled into a parking spot in front of Heart Savers at 6:09 PM. I entered the location, and there was a woman sitting at one of the desks in the front room. She looked down her nose at me without so much as a greeting. I informed her that I was there for the CPR class. She said that the video had just started and that I could not enter the classroom. I explained that there was a serious accident (as it turns out it was a deadly roll-over) on the highway that had caused the delay. Stared at me as if I was speaking a different language. I then read the telephone number I had been calling aloud to verify that I had been dialing the right number. She confirmed the number was correct, but said she didn\'t answer the phone because she was teaching the class. The problem with this was that I had called several times between 5:50 and 6:00 PM, before class was scheduled to begin. She maintained that she was teaching and could not answer the phones. I went on to explain that I had a job interview the following day and that I needed to have my new CPR card in order to be considered for the position. She shrugged her shoulders and stared. Frustrated with the situation I headed to the door and muttering under my breath. I asked the woman for her name and exited the building in shambles. \n\nOnce outside, I called the location again. Despite the fact that she was sitting in the front room where the phone was ringing, she did not answer. She just looked at the phone and then continued to do whatever it was that she was doing. I was furious! I sat in my car fuming trying to figure out what to do.  I decided that I needed to get the heck out of there, and make sure the world knows that Heart Savers treats paying customers like imbeciles? Yes! That was the perfect solution. \n\nSo here I sit, writing to say that if you value small things, like good customer service, and being treated with respect, you may want to take your business elsewhere. If this instructor is any indication of what the rest of the Heart Savers staff is like you can expect to be treated as if you are a lesser life form.\n\nI understand that rules are rules. If the policy is that no one may enter the class once the video starts, so be it. But is it really that that hard to greet a customer when they enter your establishment? And, God forbid, treating that customer with a little respect, compassion and understanding. A simple, "I am sorry but..." would have gone a long, long way in this situation.\n\nI assure you that Heart Savers will never receive a cent from me.

When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.

Ever since then, my wife and I have been motivated to refresh our CPR skills. Also, working in a healthcare profession, it's good for me to be certified anyway.\n\nA brief online search brought me to Heart Savers. They offer a great combo package of CPR, AED (automated external defibrillator), and First Aid certifications. Be sure to choose the one credentialed by the American Safety Health Institute. The locations were better than the ones offered by the Red Cross, and $50 for about 6 hours of hands-on instruction is a great deal. I paid online, but you can also pay in-person.\n\nOur class began at 8 am on Sunday morning. We got signed in with our instructor Scott and waited for class to begin. During the introduction, several students came in late. One was even 40 minutes late and still accepted. It sounds like Heart Savers has improved their customer service from several years back ;)\n\nThe instruction was great! Scott gave us a great overview of CPR procedures, explaining how to assess the victim and the steps to take depending on the severity of the situation. We then got to perform our skills on both baby and adult-sized manikins. Scott did a nice job of tying in fun movie references and kept the training lighthearted. I can't say I was ever really bored the whole time and learned a ton. \n\nAfter the CPR/AED course, we had about a 20 minute break before the First Aid session, so we ran to a nearby Circle K for snacks. The First Aid course is a little more monotonous because you go through a coursebook, but we still enjoyed learning how to handle different kinds of emergencies. \n\nNo matter what profession you're in, I really urge everyone to learn these lifesaving skills.

The instructor I had did an outstanding job, I could tell he was very experienced and cared about what he did. BUT...\n\nAt the beginning of the class I noticed out of the 10 infant mannequins only one was black. Although I found it to be a little bit weird that there was this one random black mannequin out of 10, it really didn't bother me. However, I was curious to know why they chose to have one black mannequin versus having a more diverse and balanced ethnic distribution or just having all white mannequins. But at the end of the day however a company chooses to run their  business is completely their right. So when it was time to begin our demonstration, me being the only black person in the class I decided to eliminate all awkwardness and select the black infant for myself. As you can see all the babies are dressed up in their cute little onesies but it wasn't until I got up close to my baby and noticed that it was dressed in a monkey onesie. Now I am the last person that anyone could accuse of race baiting but this immediately rubbed me the wrong way. But before I overreacted I checked all the other babies clothing to check and see if they could possibly be dressed in a monkey onesie as well. Unfortunately, that was not the case. All of the other babies were dressed in giraffe, bird, dolphin, sports, Princess onesies, etc. All but monkey onesies. Out of 10 mannequin babies the lone black baby ended up in the monkey onesie. So that means before dressing the babies there was a 10% chance that the black baby would end up in the monkey onesie but there was a 90% chance that the black baby would not. But it just so happens that it fell in the 10%? Is this a coincidence or did the person dressing the babies intentionally placed the baby in the monkey onesie?\n\nLet's just say this was done out of sheer ignorance. Does that make it ok? \n\nNow for those whites and ignorant people that don't see what the big deal is...\n\nMonkey is an extremely derogatory term used to describe black people by whites for hundreds of years and is still present to this very day. Not only were we called monkeys, the Constitution states that we are only 3/5 of a human being to begin with so seeing this in 2016 really made my stomach turn. I'm sure many out there will want these type of issues to just be swept under a rug and not be correctly addressed but this is a huge reason why society is filled with hate today because of the underlying and covert racisms that continue to remain prominent in this country.

I ordered the Friday Fish Fry, my sister ordered the Strawberry Walnut Salad, and my father ordered the California Burger. The Friday Fish Fry was decently large. It included a fried fish with tartar sauce, a mini salad with mayonnaise, lots of French fries with ketchup, and two pieces of flatbread. The fish was extraordinarily crunchy and fresh.

They always seem to check on you every five to ten minutes, and if you happen to dislike a specific channel on TV, you can tell them and they will immediately change the channel.\n\nCons:\nThe location is tiny. During a football, basketball, soccer, etc. game, the place is CROWDED, and you may have to wait about 10-30 minutes until you get seated. (Wait until the Super Bowl XLIX starts. It will be absolutely miserable waiting for a SINGLE seat.)

Cod in the norm for most restaurants that have a \nFriday fish fry and it never seems to fail.  They do have Fish and Chips on their daily menu which is Cod, so we just assumed that it would be the same fish, only with it being on special, since it was Friday.
